This Discord bot is built using the powerful Discord.js API and is designed to enhance server engagement and moderation with a mix of utility, interaction, and entertainment features. The bot is fully integrated with MongoDB for persistent data storage, ensuring user progress, settings, and logs are safely maintained across sessions.

</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In-server currency system where users earn coins through activity and gameplay.</li>
  <li>Virtual inventory and item management.</li>
  <li>Interactive exploration</li>
</ul>

I decided to incorporate interactive exploration into the game, allowing users to make choices that enhance engagement. This feature not only provides a more immersive experience but also offers rewarding incentives, such as currency and experience points, to further motivate player participation.

    üí¨ Development Challenges
</h2>

Building this Discord bot came with a number of technical and design challenges that required thoughtful decision-making and continuous iteration:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choosing the Right Technology Stack:</strong> One of the initial challenges was selecting the appropriate database and API. After evaluating various options, MongoDB was chosen for its schema flexibility and scalability, and Discord.js was selected due to its robust support for the Discord API and strong developer community.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Schema Design:</strong> Structuring and managing database schemas proved to be a complex task. Ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of user data, server configurations, inventories, and game-related elements required a well-organized schema design and careful consideration of data relationships.</li>
    <li><strong>Discord API Changes & Deprecations:</strong> Discord frequently updates its API, which led to several parts of the codebase becoming deprecated or requiring refactoring. Staying up to date with breaking changes in Discord.js and adapting to new versions was a recurring challenge throughout development.</li>
    <li><strong>User Interface Design Within Discord Constraints:</strong> Designing an intuitive and user-friendly experience using Discord‚Äôs text-based interface and embed system required creativity. The challenge was to present data and interactions clearly without overwhelming users, while maintaining a consistent and visually appealing format.</li>
</ul>
