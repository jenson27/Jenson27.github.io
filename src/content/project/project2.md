To enhance my programming skills, I decided to create a series of mini-games, each designed to challenge me with different aspects of coding. This approach allowed me to practice problem-solving, improve my understanding of various algorithms, and gain experience with different programming languages and frameworks.

<ul>
  <li>Tic-Tac-Toe: Implementing logic for checking win conditions and managing a simple AI opponent.</li>
  <li>Snake Game: Working with graphics, collision detection, and game loops.</li>
  <li>Flappy Bird Clone: Developing physics-based movement and collision detection.</li>
</ul>

Creating these mini-games has significantly improved my confidence in programming and problem-solving, making it a fun and rewarding way to learn new concepts. Moving forward, I plan to tackle more complex projects and explore game development frameworks in greater depth.
