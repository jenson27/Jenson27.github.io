To enhance my programming skills, I decided to create a series of mini-games, each designed to challenge me with different aspects of coding. This approach allowed me to practice problem-solving, improve my understanding of various algorithms, and gain experience with different programming languages and frameworks.

    üéÆ Games I've Worked On
</h2>

I began by identifying a set of simple yet engaging mini-games that would allow me to explore different programming concepts. Some of the games I worked on included:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tic-Tac-Toe:</strong> Implementing logic for checking win condition.</li>
  <li><strong>Snake Game:</strong> Working with graphics, collision detection, and game loops.</li>
  <li><strong>Flappy Bird Clone:</strong> Developing physics-based movement and collision detection.</li>
  <li><strong>Minesweeper:</strong> Practicing grid-based logic, recursive algorithms, and user interaction handling.</li>
</ul>

Diving deeper into one of the games i made, creating a Flappy Bird clone was an exciting challenge that helped me improve my understanding of physics-based movement and collision detection.

    üõ†Ô∏è Development Process
</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gravity & Jump Mechanics:</strong> Implementing a gravity effect and a jump action triggered by user input.</li>
  <li><strong>Obstacle Generation:</strong> Creating dynamically spawning pipes with gaps at varying heights.</li>
  <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> Ensuring the bird detects collisions with pipes and the ground.</li>
  <li><strong>Scoring System:</strong> Awarding points when successfully passing through obstacles.</li>
</ul>

    üêç Snake Game
</h2>

Another example i would like to show is the recreation of snake. In this classic game, I implemented the snake's movement using basic controls and collision detection. The snake grows longer each time it eats food, and the game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries. I focused on managing the game loop and handling the snake‚Äôs direction.

    üõ†Ô∏è Development Process
</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Playing Field Representation:</strong> A 2D array represents the grid, where each element indicates whether a cell is empty, contains food, or has a segment of the snake‚Äôs body.</li>
  <li><strong>Snake Representation:</strong> The snake's body is stored as a list of coordinates in the 2D array.</li>
  <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> The array is used to check for collisions between the snake‚Äôs head, its body, food, and the boundaries of the field.</li>
  <li><strong>Movement and Growth:</strong> The snake moves by updating the head‚Äôs position, and the array is updated to reflect the new position. Eating food increases the snake‚Äôs length, adding new segments.</li>
  <li><strong>Boundary Handling:</strong> Boundaries can be marked with a specific value, making it easy to detect if the snake hits a wall.</li>
</ul>

Through this process, I gained hands-on experience with:

<ul>
  <li>Implementing physics-based mechanics</li>
  <li>Understanding game loops and real-time interaction</li>
  <li>Working with user input and graphical interfaces</li>
  <li>Debugging and testing techniques</li>
  <li>Structuring projects and managing dependencies</li>
  <li>Writing clean and efficient code</li>
</ul>

Creating these mini-games has significantly improved my confidence in programming and problem-solving, making it a fun and rewarding way to learn new concepts. Moving forward, I plan to tackle more complex projects and explore game development frameworks in greater depth.
