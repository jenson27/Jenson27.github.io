To enhance my programming skills, I decided to create a series of mini-games, each designed to challenge me with different aspects of coding. This approach allowed me to practice problem-solving, improve my understanding of various algorithms, and gain experience with different programming languages and frameworks.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tic-Tac-Toe:</strong> Implementing logic for checking win conditions and managing a simple AI opponent.</li>
  <li><strong>Snake Game:</strong> Working with graphics, collision detection, and game loops.</li>
  <li><strong>Flappy Bird Clone:</strong> Developing physics-based movement and collision detection.</li>
  <li><strong>Minesweeper:</strong> Practicing grid-based logic, recursive algorithms, and user interaction handling.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="card-title">
    The key aspects of development included:
</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gravity & Jump Mechanics:</strong> Implementing a gravity effect and a jump action triggered by user input.</li>
  <li><strong>Obstacle Generation:</strong> Creating dynamically spawning pipes with gaps at varying heights.</li>
  <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> Ensuring the bird detects collisions with pipes and the ground.</li>
  <li><strong>Scoring System:</strong> Awarding points when successfully passing through obstacles.</li>
</ul>

    Key Takeaways
</h2>

Through this process, I gained hands-on experience with:

<ul>
  <li>Implementing physics-based mechanics</li>
  <li>Understanding game loops and real-time interaction</li>
  <li>Working with user input and graphical interfaces</li>
  <li>Debugging and testing techniques</li>
  <li>Structuring projects and managing dependencies</li>
  <li>Writing clean and efficient code</li>
</ul>

Creating these mini-games has significantly improved my confidence in programming and problem-solving, making it a fun and rewarding way to learn new concepts. Moving forward, I plan to tackle more complex projects and explore game development frameworks in greater depth.
