This certification course from NVIDIA introduces the basics of deep learning in a really hands-on, practical way. It covers how neural networks work, how to train them, and how to improve their performance. You get to build and train models using popular tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and apply them to real tasks like image recognition.

The course also dives into key concepts like activation functions, loss optimization, overfitting, and how to speed things up using GPUs. By the end, you walk away with a solid foundation in deep learning and an official certificate from NVIDIA.

<h2>Key learning outcomes:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Build, train, and evaluate deep neural networks using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.</li>
  <li>Understand key components of deep learning such as convolutional and fully connected layers.</li>
  <li>Apply deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems such as image classification and object recognition.</li>
  <li>Leverage GPU acceleration for faster model training and experimentation.</li>
</ul>

By the end of the course, learners gain the skills needed to start developing deep learning applications and are awarded an NVIDIA DLI certificate of competency.
